title: "RIVM-Toolbox"
---

In the last years at the RIVM much research has been done on data management and on the development of statistical methods for “data wrangling” (such as cleaning, transforming, merging data…), as well as for visualization of complex multivariable associations. The toolbox will implement these already available developments in combination with the new requirements in a user-friendly format, using the R language, and making them available to the scientific community within the RIVM as well as (inter)nationally.  

At present, the toolbox consists of three modules ( _biomeUtils_, _biomeViz_ and _biomeStats_).
